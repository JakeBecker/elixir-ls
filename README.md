# Elixir Language Server (ElixirLS)

The Elixir Language Server provides a server that runs in the background, providing IDEs, editors, and other tools with information about Elixir Mix projects. It adheres to the [Language Server Protocol](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol), a standard for frontend-independent IDE support. Debugger integration is accomplished through the similar [VS Code Debug Protocol](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensionAPI/api-debugging).

## This project has moved!

It's now being maintained by proactive volunteers from the Elixir community over at [elixir-lsp](https://github.com/elixir-lsp)/[elixir-ls](https://github.com/elixir-lsp/elixir-ls). Updates will continue to be published from that repo to the original VS Code extension, so no need to switch plugins if you're using VS Code.

Thanks for using ElixirLS!
